## ABSTRACT
Automate the essential functionalities of YouTube as a social media platform to ensure seamless user experience and feature reliability. The automation will cover key actions such as logging in, searching for videos, skipping ads, and interacting with video content. In today's digital age, e-commerce and social media platforms play a pivotal role in the daily lives of millions of users. Ensuring the seamless functionality of these applications is crucial, given their complexity and the dynamic nature of their user interfaces. Manual testing of these applications is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error and inconsistency. Furthermore, frequent updates and deployments necessitate repetitive regression testing to ensure that new features and fixes do not introduce new issues.

## LIMITATIONS
	• YouTube content is highly dynamic, with frequent updates and changes, making it challenging 
       to create stable and reliable automated tests.
	• Ensuring tests work across different browsers and browser versions can be complex due to 
       variations in rendering and behavior.
	• Implementing robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to deal with unexpected pop-ups, 
       errors, or site downtime.


## PROJECT SCOPE
	• Identifying and prioritizing critical functionalities of social media web applications 
       for automation testing.
	• Developing and maintaining automated test scripts using Selenium WebDriver.
	• Integrating the automated testing framework with a continuous integration tool like 
       selenium to enable continuous testing.
	• Executing the automated test cases on different web browsers to ensure cross-browser 
       compatibility.
	• Analysing the test results and generating comprehensive test reports.
